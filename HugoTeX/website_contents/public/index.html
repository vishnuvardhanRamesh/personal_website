                    I am a senior Computer Engineering student at Texas A&amp;M. I have technical experience in digital design
  and verification, FPGA/ASIC design, comptuer architecture, electronics, and embedded systems. This portfolio
  contains technical reports about the various projects I&#39;ve done throughout my years in college. If you&#39;re
  new to this page, I would recommend checking my &#34;Research Proposal and Reccomendation Report&#34; technical writing work, or
  my &#34;HTAX Verification&#34; overview on hardware design.

      <p><p>Hardware verification is a integral part of the chip design process. Failures to catch defects can cost millions of dollars for companies. Software bugs can often be patched with a quick update, but most hardware faults can only be fixed by recalling the chip and replacing it.</p>
<p>Because of this, Verification Engineers are often employed by companies for the sole purpose of debugging and catching errors in the design before final chip tape out.</p></p>

      <p><p>Creating an adder in Python takes about thirty seconds. As a matter of fact, in almost every programming language this simple addition operation a miniscule amount of time to program. Writing an adder in assembly code may take slightly longer, though it will still not be a problem. Creating an 8-bit adder as an IC design took me almost six weeks to accomplish.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, <em>physical integrated chip design</em> refers to strips of metal connecting to each other, sending electrical current one way or the other. Controlling the flow of electricity throughout these strips of metal can be a complicated process, and eventually ends up looking something like this.</p></p>

      <p><p>Image processing is a great application for hardware design, as typical image processing algorithms involve large amounts of data processing and math operations. This project goes over a <strong>Canny Edge Detector</strong>, which takes an input image and outputs an image with all the edges outlined. This is typically done by finding sharp discontinuities in an image. This algorithm has high computation, as it utilizes Noise Reduction, Gradient Calculation, Non-Maximum Suppresion, and Hysterisis Thresholding. This creates a highly accurate output image that classifies all borders present in the image.</p></p>
