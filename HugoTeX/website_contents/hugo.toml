  I am a senior Computer Engineering student at Texas A&M. I have technical experience in digital design
  and verification, FPGA/ASIC design, comptuer architecture, electronics, and embedded systems. This portfolio
  contains technical reports about the various projects I've done throughout my years in college. If you're
  new to this page, I would recommend checking my "Research Proposal and Reccomendation Report" technical writing work, or
  my "HTAX Verification" overview on hardware design.
