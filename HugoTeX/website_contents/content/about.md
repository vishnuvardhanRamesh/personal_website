My name is Vishnuvardhan Ramesh. I am a Computer Engineering student at Texas A&M (class of 2025) with a major interest in VLSI and the semiconductor industry.

I am currently an undergraduate researcher working under Dr. Jiang Hu, researching how to use machine learning to enhance EDA tools. I focus on creating a large amount of training data to expand upon and improve the results of a paper detailing [Flip-Flop Incremental Placement](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3670474.3685949).

I am familiar with digital design and verification projects. Some of these projects include the efficient implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network that is designed for optimal performance on an FPGA. Furthermore, I created a Canny Edge Detector circuit in both Verilog and SystemC, used for image processing. Finally, I utilized UVM and SystemVerilog for verification of an HTAX (Hyper-Transport Advanced Crossbar) communication module. 

I am ultimately looking to pursue a career in working on technical writing or interesting projects involving hardware design.
