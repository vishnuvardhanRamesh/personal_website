During the Spring 2024 semester, I had the opportunity to learn about technical writing, and working on various applications including professional emails, letters, memorands, research proposals, and a final reccomendation report. In this post I would like to showcase two papers. One is a individual research proposal to a Texas A&M organization, and the other is a group reccomendation report.

These reports enhanced my skills for creating technical documents that adhered to strict formatting guidelines. Throughout the semester I learned how to create a proposal and actually carry that proposal out, sticking to the schedule I outlined at the beginning and keeping all deadlines in mind. I then learned how to analyze the results and present a technical argument for further steps that can be taken.

## Research Proposal

This paper is a research proposal to Quant A&M, a STEM organization that focuses on teaching about quantum science applications. This proposal is a request to carry out an investigation on how to increase engagement during Quant A&M meetings. I created a list of proposed tasks that involve surveying members and observing current engagement levels. I also cited sources on proposed ways to increase engagement in college organizations, and finally descibed my own qualifications as to why I am capable of carrying out this research.

## Reccomendation Report

Afterwards, a group project was initiated to actually carry out a research proposal. The final results and further steps would be compiled in a reccomendation report. A study was carried out on the org MSC ALOT, with the goal of enhacning freshmen engagement within the organization. The report was throughouly organized and formatted with the guidelines that Texas A&M reccomended.
